This is some Mathematica code that draws a [Koch Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) and writes the message 'Merry Christmas' inside it.

It was originally written to start the WalkingRandomly Mathematical Christmas Card Challenge back in 2008 http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=395

To use it, copy and paste the code into a Mathematica notebook and execute it.
