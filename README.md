# christmas_card_code

A set of code projects that generate electronic christmas cards. This is meant as a bit of fun to get people writing code, using git and joining an open source project.

Each project should have it's own folder and, ideally, a README.md file which should be in Markdown format.

There are folders for various programming languages. If your code is in a language that isn't covered, please create it and put your project inside it.
